## Hi there 👋

<!--
**yn280/yn280** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hello world!

- 🔭 I am currently a Computational Biologist based at University of Cambridge and MRC-Mitochondrial Biology Unit. Previously I have obtained my PhD degree on Pharmaceutical Sciences from King’s College London and worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow of Leverhulme Trust in Canterbury Christ Church University .
- 🌱 I am intrigued by ageing-related questions. Specifically, I investigate the changes in our genomic materials within mitochondria, the cellular energy repository, during the ageing process and how these alterations manifest in ageing-related diseases such as dementia and cancer.
- 🤔 To achieve this, I develop and employ advanced dry lab tools to analyse multi-omic and spatial sequencing data, seeking biomarkers and modulators at the single-cell level.
- 👯 Additionally, I collaborate extensively on disease mechanism studies and am involved in the clinical trials of treatments for related rare diseases. 
- 💬 Research interest: Parkinson’s disease, neurodegeneration, dementia, ageing, brain development, mitochondrial DNA, mutation, deletion, single cell, spatial genomics, proteomics, organoid.
- ⚡ Key skills: 
*Genetic Data Analysis: R, Python, Bash
*Genetic Research Methods: NGS and ONT sequencing, 10X, RNAseq, ATACseq, Xenium, Proteomics
*Genetic Statistics: Frequentist statistics, Bayesian inference, GWAS
*High-Performance Computing: Slurm, PBS, Singularity, Docker
*Software Development: Version Control (Git), Workflow Development (Nextflow, Snakemake)
