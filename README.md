## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ I am currently a Computational Biologist based at University of Cambridge and MRC-Mitochondrial Biology Unit. Previously I have obtained my PhD degree on Pharmaceutical Sciences from Kingâ€™s College London and worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow of Leverhulme Trust in Canterbury Christ Church University.
- ðŸŒ± I am intrigued by ageing-related questions. Specifically, I investigate the changes in our genomic materials within mitochondria, the cellular energy repository, during the ageing process and how these alterations manifest in ageing-related diseases such as dementia and cancer.
- ðŸ¤” To achieve this, I develop and employ advanced dry lab tools to analyse multi-omic and spatial sequencing data, seeking biomarkers and modulators at the single-cell level.
- ðŸ‘¯ Additionally, I collaborate extensively on disease mechanism studies and am involved in the clinical trials of treatments for related rare diseases. 
- ðŸ’¬ Research interest: Parkinsonâ€™s disease, neurodegeneration, dementia, ageing, brain development, mitochondrial DNA, mutation, deletion, single cell, spatial genomics, proteomics, organoid.
- âš¡ Key skills: 
*Genetic Data Analysis: R, Python, Bash
*Genetic Research Methods: NGS and ONT sequencing, 10X, RNAseq, ATACseq, Xenium, Proteomics
*Genetic Statistics: Frequentist statistics, Bayesian inference, GWAS
*High-Performance Computing: Slurm, PBS, Singularity, Docker
*Software Development: Version Control (Git), Workflow Development (Nextflow, Snakemake)
